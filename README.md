# A Comparative Assessment of JVM Frameworks to Develop Microservices
---

This project aimed to compare chosen application frameworks based on Java Virtual Machine suitable for microservices and provide support for GraalVM native images. Framework choice was based on the defined criteria.

## Compared frameworks

- [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)
- [Micronaut](https://micronaut.io/)
- [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io/)

## Docker images

Docker images are located in the single [repository](https://hub.docker.com/r/latusikl/comparative-analysis/tags) and distinguised by tag.
